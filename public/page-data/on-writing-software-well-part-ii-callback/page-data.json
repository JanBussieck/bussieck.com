To the last point, DDH explains that while callbacks are\nsupposed to contain code that should run by default, it might sometimes be\nnecessary to disable them.\n\nFinally, after checking whether we should perform any work and scan for\nmentions, the actual work is delegated to a job via eavesdrop_for_mentions, the\njob simply instantiates an instance of Mention::Eavesdropper which creates the\nactual mentions. Also, note how the method Current, a class that allows global,\nper-request storage of attributes, is used to pass the current user as mentioner\nto the job.\n\nclass Mention::EavesdroppingJob < ApplicationJob\n  queue_as :background\n\n  def perform(recording, mentioner)\n    Current.set(account: recording.account) do\n      Mention::EavesDropper.new(recording, mentioner).create_mentions\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe EavesDropper in turn invokes a scanner that finds mentionees and creates\nmentions.\n\nclass Mention::Eavesdropper\n  extend Suppressible\n  ...\n  def create_mentions\n    recording.with_lock do\n      mentionees.each do |mentionee, callsign|\n        create_mention mentionee, callsign\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThat is it, we moved the ancillary concern of creating mentions off to the side,\nby handling it in callbacks as response to certain life cycle events of our\nmodel as opposed to the 'main path' of our code inside the controller action. A\ndeveloper interested in the main path i.e. creating messages is not confronted\nwith the complexity of creating mentions right away. While it is true that this\nreduces some cognitive load in that specific case, it comes at non-negligible\ncost.\nNote how we had to trace the feature of creating mentions in response to a\nchange to a recordable record all the way from the controller, through the\nmodel's life cycle methods to a job and finally a service creating the mentions.\nAlong the way we are given hints that this level of coupling is fraught with\nsome amount amount of complication.\n\nTracking dirty attributes\nFirst off, we need intricate knowledge about Rails life cycle methods in order\nto be able to track changes to a recording and know whether we should even check\nfor mentions. I need to be cognizant of database transaction and how they relate\nto callbacks to even become aware of how to track model changes in after_commit.\nTalk about incidental complexity.\n\nChecking for suppression in callbacks\nSecondly, apparently, there are use cases where the client (whoever is\ninitiating those model updates) might not want to listen for mentions, maybe I\nam seeding data or going through an admin API that I don't want to trigger\nsending emails. Quite plausible. In those cases, I need to check whether\ncreating mention eavesdroppers has explicitly been suppressed. The problems\nintroduced by this sort of coupling have been addressed in this post. But it\nagain strikes me as very counterintuitive and error-prone to reach into a\ncompletely different class, whose internal state has been modified elsewhere in\norder to decide whether to run a callback or not.\n\nUsing Current to store request-wide state\nFinally, a problem that results from handling these types of interactions deep\ndown in active record models is that I still need information from the\ncontroller. In this case, a global object is used to register that information\nmaking it globally accessible in the entire application. That should be the\nclearest indication that I might be performing work in a class that has to know\ntoo much in order to perform it and hence might be the wrong place to do it.\n\nThe controller as mediator\nThat's enough for criticisms. I think the highlighted problems all indicate that\nwe shouldn't know what the we are trying to know inside the callback, because we\nare too far removed from where those decisions occur; the controller.\n\nI have always thought of the controller, more specifically a controller action,\nas a mediator [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern] encapsulating\nknowledge about a particular use case and deciding which models need to talk to\nwhich and what they need to know to accomplish their particular tasks. The\ncontroller orchestrates, passes on information and creates side effects, much in\nthe vein of Gary Bernhardt's functional core / imperative shell\n[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell]\n.\n\nAt speqtor.com [http://speqtor.com], we have a similar feature to Basecamp's\nmentions where certain updates to models create notifications for different\nusers subscribed to that model.\n\nA typical controller action looks like this:\n\ndef update\n  load_criterion\n  build_criterion\n  authorize_criterion\n\n  subscribe_listeners(@criterion)\n\n  save_criterion\n\n  decorate_criterion\n  render_criterion\nend\n\n\nWe like sticking to the same structure in every controller which makes them easy\nto understand and to spot where interesting things are happening (See the\nexcellent Growing Rails Applications in Practice\n[https://leanpub.com/growing-rails]). Here, we are updating a criterion that\nindicates how complex a project is going to be. In this specific use case, a\nuser directly interacts with our web app, as opposed to an importer job or the\nrails console. In this context we want a number of side effects to happen as a\nresult of certain model events. This is achieved by registering event listeners,\nwhich in turn decide what is supposed to happen as a result of those changes.\n\nIn our example, we want to listen to successful updates in order to notify other\nusers.\n\nThis happens inside the SubscribesListeners concern:\n\ndef subscribe_notification_listener(options = {})\n  with_load_error_guard do\n    listener_class = options[:notification_listener_class] || infer_listener\n    listener = listener_class.new\n\n    listener.current_user = current_user\n    listener.changes = subscription_target.changes.transform_values do |val|\n      val.map(&:to_s)\n    end\n\n    subscription_target.subscribe listener, async: true\n  end\nend\n\n\nHere, we are instantiating the listener class, pass in the information it needs,\ni.e. model changes and the current user and subscribe it to the target model (in\nthis case the criterion). Often we add other information available in the\ncontroller, such as the scope of the current project or user permissions. The\nlistener, in turn, simply creates the notification.\n\nSimple enough.\n\nHow are the above problems solved here?\n\nRegarding dirty attribute tracking; since we haven't persisted the model yet, we\ncan still access model changes though the attributes api, when the model is\nsaved and the database transaction completes, the listener is merely notified of\nits success or failure.\n\nAs we are still inside the controller context we can also pass any information\nsuch as the current user to the listener without having to awkwardly store it in\na global Current.\n\nLastly, the listener is maximally decoupled, we have to explicitly opt into\ncreating notifications depending on the current use case, as opposed to\nanticipating every use case by checking related models for suppression.\n\nAn additional benefit is that, we can now easily background the listener without\nhaving to worry  about implicit state in the form of model suppression or \nCurrent registries.\n\nSo what should callbacks be used for?\n\nI am not a big fan of hard and fast rules in software design, but sometimes it's\nprudent to have certain guidelines to stick to unless there is a very good\nreason for violating them.\n\nOne of them is that callbacks should only deal with immediate model concerns,\nwhich are in declining order of popularity:\n\n 1. Maintaining data integrity and mutating the model into a valid state,\n    examples are normalizing or splitting attributes.\n 2. Mutate a closely associated model, for instance counter caches in a\n    one-to-many association.\n 3.
