So each React element is turned into a fiber node of\ncorresponding type\n[https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/769b1f270e1251d9dbdce0fcbd9e92e502d059b8/packages/shared/ReactWorkTags.js] \nthat keeps record of the work to be done building up a work in progress tree.\nThink of a fiber as representing a unit of work that can be independently\nscheduled, paused and aborted.\nWhen an update is called React will add the update to a component update queue,\nfor instance, when setState was called on render React calls the updater\nfunction which was passed into setState. After the updater is finished the fiber\ngets a tag that a change needs to be made in the DOM.\nThe list of changes are propagated up to the parent fiber and merged into its\nlist of changes. This list of changes is also called effect list. Now the work\nin progress tree is marked as a pending commit.\n\nThose changes are not immediately committed to a rendering target such as the\nDOM.  That happens in the commit phase, this phase is atomic and cannot be\ninterrupted, otherwise there might be UI inconsistencies.\nDuring the commit phase React iterates over the effect list and makes its\nchanges to the rendering target (e.g. DOM).\n\nLet’s look at some code:\nuseEffect is defined in ReactHooks.js and its type signature clues us in to how\nit works; it accepts as first argument a function creating the effect, which\noptionally returns a function (cleaning up the effect) and as second argument\neither an optional array of inputs (the dependency array) of varying type.\nWe see that the functions first resolves a dispatcher and then delegates to it.\n\n//react/blob/master/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js#L104\nexport function useEffect(\n  create: () => (() => void) | void,\n  inputs: Array<mixed> | void | null,\n) {\n  const dispatcher = resolveDispatcher();\n  return dispatcher.useEffect(create, inputs);\n}\n\n\nThe hook dispatchers are resolved depending on the current context, if it's the\ninitial render and the component just mounted HooksDispatcherOnMount and\notherwise HooksDispatcherOnUpdate is returned, correspondingly the dispatcher\nreturns either mountEffect or updateEffect.\n\n//react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.old.js#L570\nconst HooksDispatcherOnMount: Dispatcher = {\n\t...\n  useEffect: mountEffect,\n  ...\n};\n\nconst HooksDispatcherOnUpdate: Dispatcher = {\n  ...\n  useEffect: updateEffect,\n  ...\n}\n\n\nWithout looking at the implementation from our experience working with useEffect \nwe know that these cases differ in at least one respect; the create function of \nuseEffect is always invoked on mount, regardless of its second argument.\n\nLet us first look at the more common update case. updateEffect delegates to \nupdateEffectImpl to pass in the current fiber and hook effect tags. I don’t want\nto go too much into effect tags here, suffice it to mention that each fiber’s\neffects are encoded in an effectTag, they define  thework\n[https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/shared/ReactSideEffectTags.js] \nthat needs to be done for instances after updates have been processed, similarly\nthere are hook effect tags carrying information about the hook effect's context,\ne.g. whether the component is unmounting or whether the effect should be invoked\nat all (the NoHookEffect tag).\nupdateEffectImpl first calls updateWorkInProgress to get a new hook instance,\nwhich is basically just a clone of the current hook or if we are in a\nwork-in-progress tree the current work-in-progress hook:\n\nconst newHook: Hook = {\n  memoizedState: currentHook.memoizedState,\n\n  baseState: currentHook.baseState,\n  queue: currentHook.queue,\n  baseUpdate: currentHook.baseUpdate,\n\n  next: null,\n};\n\n\nWhen a hook is called in our component it builds up a queue where hooks are\nrepresented as linked list in their call order with each hook’s next field\npointing to the next hook. Since these are copied over from each render, we see\nwhy we cannot call hooks conditionally or change their call order from render to\nrender.\nThe baseState and baseUpdate fields are relevant to useState and useDispatch \nhooks,useEffect most importantly uses memoizedState to hold a reference to the\nprevious effect. Let’s look at why.\n\n//react/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.old.js#L1218\nfunction updateEffectImpl(fiberEffectTag, hookEffectTag, create, deps): void {\n  const hook = updateWorkInProgressHook();\n  const nextDeps = deps === undefined ? null : deps;\n  let destroy = undefined;\n\n  if (currentHook !== null) {\n    const prevEffect = currentHook.memoizedState;\n    destroy = prevEffect.destroy;\n    if (nextDeps !== null) {\n      const prevDeps = prevEffect.deps;\n      if (areHookInputsEqual(nextDeps, prevDeps)) {\n        pushEffect(NoHookEffect, create, destroy, nextDeps);\n        return;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  sideEffectTag |= fiberEffectTag;\n  hook.memoizedState = pushEffect(hookEffectTag, create, destroy, nextDeps);\n}\n\n\nThe most interesting thing happening here is that if there is a currentHook we\nfetch the previous effect from the hook’s memoizedState field to get the\nprevious dependencies and compare them to the next dependencies. If they are\nequal we push an effect onto the queue with the NoHookEffect tag and return,\nwhich means that the effect will still be run during commit, but it won’t be\nexecuted (its create function won't be invoked). Finally, if the dependencies\nare not equal, we push the effect onto the queue with an effect tag that ensures\nthe effect will fire.\nAs a side note areHookInputsEqual delegates to Object.is instead of a plain\nobject reference comparison to catch javascript quirks such as NaN === NaN //\nfalse.\n\nWe skip over the source ofmountEffectImpl here, since it only differs from \nupdateEffectImpl in that it does not check the dependency array and simply\npushes the hook on the effect queue to be executed.\n\nThat is basically all that happens during reconciliation; values from previous\nuseEffect hooks are cloned, the new dependencies compared to previous ones which\nwere saved on the memoizedState field to determine whether the effect should\nfire or not and that information is pushed on the effect queue.\n\nThe next time we see our effect is after React has finished reconciliation,\nevery render has been called and the list of updates to be committed to the\nrendering target aggregated. We are in the commit phase now and commitWork calls \ncommitHookEffectList:\n\nfunction commitWork(current: Fiber | null, finishedWork: Fiber): void {\n\t...\n  commitHookEffectList(UnmountMutation, MountMutation, finishedWork);\n\t...\n}\n\n\n commitHookEffectList in turn iterates over the effect list, checks the tag to\ndetermine in which phase the effect has been added to the list and fires create \nor destroy respectively.\nWe see that in the case of an unmountTag the destroy clean up function is\ncalled. In case, we are in an update phase, create is called firing the effect,\nbut destroy is simply saved on the effect for future reference in the unmount\nphase. If the effect has been tagged with NoHookEffect it is simply skipped.\n\n// react/ReactFiberCommitWork.old.js at master · facebook/react\nfunction commitHookEffectList(\n  unmountTag: number,\n  mountTag: number,\n  finishedWork: Fiber,\n) {\n  const updateQueue: FunctionComponentUpdateQueue | null = (finishedWork.updateQueue: any);\n  let lastEffect = updateQueue !== null ? updateQueue.lastEffect : null;\n  if (lastEffect !== null) {\n    const firstEffect = lastEffect.next;\n    let effect = firstEffect;\n    do {\n      if ((effect.tag & unmountTag) !== NoHookEffect) {\n        // Unmount\n        const destroy = effect.destroy;\n        effect.destroy = undefined;\n        if (destroy !== undefined) {\n          destroy();\n        }\n      }\n      if ((effect.tag & mountTag) !== NoHookEffect) {\n        // Mount\n        const create = effect.create;\n        effect.destroy = create();\n\n        if (__DEV__) {...}\n      }\n      effect = effect.next;\n    } while (effect !== firstEffect);\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow we also see why the code we run in useEffect cannot take advantage of fibers\nwhich are able to pause in order to let other higher priority work finish before\nrendering is resumed. This is because the effect is executed inside of \ncommitWork which makes atomic changes to the rendering target to avoid UI\ninconsistencies. This is important to bear in mind lest one is tempted to\nperform computationally intensive, synchronous work inside a useEffect hook.\n\nI hope this basic understanding of how useEffect works under the hood in mind\nhelps you become more confident working with useEffect and avoid common\npitfalls. It may also have encouraged you to pull away the curtain once in a\nwhile and take a look at the React source to deepen your understanding. The most\ndifficult to understand parts of the code are often related to performance and\nother house-keeping, but you shouldn't let that shroud your understanding of the\ncentral pieces that are concerned with React’s core functionality.\nHappy source reading!","html":"<p>The best way I have found to really have an accurate mental model of the programming abstractions I use whether compilers, promises or frameworks like react, it is to crack open the blackbox and understand the essential implementation details.<br>While there are a number of excellent posts on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/11/deep-dive-how-do-react-hooks-really-work/\">how hooks work under the hood</a>, the inner workings of useEffect and how it relates to the lifecycle of a component continue to be a source of puzzlement for many.<br>As I’ll attempt to show when you peak behind the curtain the <code>useEffect</code> hook’s implementation is quite straightforward and fits elegantly into React’s reconciliation algorithm.<br>By the end I hope we’ll be able to confidently answer questions such as:</p><ul><li>Why do we have to call <code>useEffect</code> in the same order?</li><li>How are hooks represented by a fibre?</li><li>How exactly are values in the dependency array compared?</li><li>When and how are effects cleaned up?</li><li>Why can’t I take advantage of React fibre in my useEffect callbacks?</li></ul><p>First, let’s briefly recap how React fibers and the reconciliation algorithm work; during reconciliation React builds up a work-in-progress fiber tree and computes a set of changes computed by walking the component tree and recursively calling <code>render</code>.
